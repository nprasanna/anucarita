Behaviour Driven Development based DSL framework for UI automation testing. It is based on customizable Domain Specific Language. Automation code is generated by converting DSL


How it works

1. Define the actions in the HTML file. for example 

Click This link
Type text in Text field

2. Run the HTML parser to convert this into code. Running the parser will generate two files, one is the code file(now .java) another is locator file where you specify id,name,css for 'This link'

Click("This link")
Type("Text field","text")

3. Fill the locator file

This.link=id=someid
Text.field=name=somefield

4. Run the automation code. 

Relationship of how the HTML parser converts this DSL syntax into automation code can be specified or modified. Please see the DSL Conversion Syntax page for more information.
